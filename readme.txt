Head Meta Data (formerly "Head Metadata Plus") adds a complete set of &lt;meta&gt; tags to the &lt;head&gt; section of all posts &amp; pages.

== Description ==

Head Meta Data improves the definition and semantic quality of your web pages by adding a complete set of `&lt;meta&gt;` tags to the `&lt;head&gt;` section of your web pages.

**Example**

	&lt;head&gt;
	
		&lt;meta name="abstract" content="Obsessive Web & Graphic Design."&gt;
		&lt;meta name="author" content="Perishable"&gt;
		&lt;meta name="classification" content="Website Design"&gt;
		&lt;meta name="copyright" content="© Perishable Press - All rights Reserved."&gt;
		&lt;meta name="designer" content="Monzilla Media"&gt;

This plugin is designed to complete a site's head construct by including some of the more obscure meta tags, such as "author", "copyright", "designer", and so forth. As a matter of practicality, the more widely used tags such as "description" and "keywords" have been omitted, as they are already included via wide variety of plugins (such as "All in One SEO") in a more dynamic way. Even so, adding "description", "keyword", or any other tags is easy from the plugin's settings page. Note: the metadata output via this plugin applies to the entire site.

== Installation ==

Typical plugin install: upload, activate, and customize in the WP Admin. Visit the "Head Meta Data" settings page for more information.

== Upgrade Notice ==

To upgrade Head Meta Data, remove old version and replace with new version. Nothing else needs done.
